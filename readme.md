## Pull requests

If we are not sure about our changes, and wish to discuss them before we push them to branch, we have the option to add a pull requst.
Creating a pull request is adding our changes to the queue of changes waiting for accept, without making them directly in branch. This allows other team members to review changed files, check our comment, and even add comments to the our lines of code. Accepting a pull request is connected with introducing changes to the branch, and running pipelines configured with the given branch.
